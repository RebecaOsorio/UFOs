McMinnville is famous for its sightings and even has an annual Gathering of UFO enthusiasts. It's a topic that Dana has been interested in since she was a child when she first heard about farmer Trentâ€™s sighting back in 1950.

During the module we worked in the construction of a table by:

* Add a date-filter function, and use d3 to listen the button event.
*  Use Bootstrap Grid to customize the page.
